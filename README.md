# Live Project-Csharp Asp.Net MVC

<h2>Introduction<h2>
  <p>This was a two week live project at prosper IT Consulting where I worked with a team of developers to build an interactive
    website for a theater company to manage its website content using MVC Crud Technology. This site included multiple areas to manage
    admin, subscriber, and general website needs as well and included information on the current and past productions, cast members, ect.
    
    The project was built using ASP.Net MVC and Entity Framework in C# with Bootstrap styling. 
    We used Visual Studio as the IDE with Azure Devops and Agile/Scrum methodologies to  develop this project.</p>
